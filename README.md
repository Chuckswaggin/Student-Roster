# Student-Roster
Class project to make Student classes and a Roster class to contain them

This project was done for a Programming class. As such, it is not built to be general, but rather to meet the requirements for submission. There are many things that could be done to improve, such as more error checking, variable Roster size, more constructors, ability to read Student information from file, etc.

Also the main function is in Roster.cpp
